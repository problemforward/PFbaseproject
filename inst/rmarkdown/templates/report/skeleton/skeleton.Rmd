# Executive Summary
The meat of the report. For our client's who just want the answer quickly, it's right here up front as the most important tidbit. We can talk executive summary formatting soon.

# Report
A more detailed step-by-step guide for clients with the following sections:

## Problem Definition
This section essentially describes what the request from the client was, and how we defined the problem as a data science question. 

## Results
Basically, everything that popped out at the end of our final project for the client.

For example, this is a great place to put descriptive plots:

```{r plot}
example1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=factor(carb))) +
  labs(x="Fuel efficiency (mpg)", y="Weight (tons)",
       title="Seminal ggplot2 scatterplot example",
       subtitle="A plot that is only useful for demonstration purposes")

example1 + theme_pf()
```

### Interpretation
How we interpret that finding / what it implies

## Methods 
What we did to generate a finding

### Assumptions
Any assumptions our team made during the process, or clarifications that are required

## Next steps
What happens next. This could be:
 - following up with client in the following week to review the project
 - further work we plan on the job (if it is ongoing)
 - questions that we have that the client can help us answer

```{r sessioninfo}
sesinfo <- pander_return(session_info())
writeLines(c("# Report Session Info:",
             "This section can be safely ignored by the client.",
             "It is for Problem Forward internal use.",
             "",
             format(Sys.time(), tz = "EST"),
             sesinfo), 
           con = "sessioninfo.md")
```
