# 1. Executive Summary
The meat of the report. For our client's who just want the answer quickly, it's right here up front as the most important tidbit. We can talk executive summary formatting soon.

# 2. Report
A more detailed step-by-step guide for clients with the following sections:

## 2.1. Problem Definition
This section essentially describes what the request from the client was, and how we defined the problem as a data science question. 

## 2.2. Results
Basically, everything that popped out at the end of our final project for the client.

For example, this is a great place to put descriptive plots:

```{r plot}
example_1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=factor(carb))) +
  labs(x="Fuel efficiency (mpg)",
       y="Weight (tons)",
       color="Carb",
       title="GGPlotly",
       subtitle="A plot that is only useful for demonstration")

clean_ggplotly(example_1)
```

Or a HTML formatted table:

```{r table}
# Use kable to format a dataframe into a nice table
kable(mtcars[1:8,]) %>% 
  # Pipe to kable_styling() for default 
  kable_styling()
```

If you want to use tabbed content, be sure to use the .tabset-fade and .tabset-pills options:

### Tabbed Content {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### Tab 1

Here is Tab 1!

#### Tab 2

Here is Tab 2!

### 2.2.1.Interpretation
How we interpret that finding / what it implies

## 2.3. Methods 
What we did to generate a finding

### 2.3.1. Assumptions
Any assumptions our team made during the process, or clarifications that are required

# 3. Next steps

What happens next. This could be:
 - following up with client in the following week to review the project
 - further work we plan on the job (if it is ongoing)
 - questions that we have that the client can help us answer

```{r sessioninfo}
# This code chunk generates a .md file with the session info for Problem Forward to use for debugging purposes. It can be safely ignored by the client.

writeLines(c("# Report Session Info:",
              "This section can be safely ignored by the client.",
              "It is for Problem Forward internal use.",
              "",
              format(Sys.time(), tz = "EST"),
              "",
              pander(session_info())), 
            con = paste0("sessioninfo_",
                         Sys.Date(),
                         ".md"),
            sep = "\n")
```
